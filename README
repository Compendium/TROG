COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
========================

PLEASE use an up-to-date compiler. This project uses a bunch of C++0x features
and older versions of GCC won't compile it. I suggest AT LEAST 4.7.0. clang also
has been shown to compile from version 3.0 or later, although I'm making no
guarantees.

Dependencies
------------

Any version of ncurses from the last 10 years should do you. Do remember to get
the -devel package if you're using a Debian-based system (i.e. Ubuntu).
